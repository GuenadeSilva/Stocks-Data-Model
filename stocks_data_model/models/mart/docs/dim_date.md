{% docs dim_date %}

Date dimension table generated via a complete date spine from `{{ start_date }}`
to `{{ end_date }}`. It includes comprehensive Gregorian, ISO, and fiscal calendar
attributes, along with boundary markers (start/end of month, quarter, year) and
analytical flags such as weekend and relative-day indicators.
This dimension serves as a foundational calendar structure for time-series
analysis, reporting, and period-over-period computations.
